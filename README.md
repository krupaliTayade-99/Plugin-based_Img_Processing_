# Plugin-based_Img_Processing_
A Major Project part of graduation Final Year submission, during May 2021.
Team Lead : Aditya Kumar
Team Members: Ankit Gore, Krupali Tayade, Priyanka Chikane

The project aims to describe the plug-in-based system framework for image processing. The
main aim of developing this plug-in-based framework is to make image processing easier for
the users. We are developing software for image processing using a plug-in-based system
framework. In this more plug-in can be added in order to perform different operations on
image. A framework will be developed to open an image. The user can open the image and
perform certain operations like colour transformation etc. The result of the project being
implemented is supposed to provide accurate colour transformation of the given image as the
output, which specifies that plug-in-based framework works in an intended way.

This project was executed in association with Bitbucket, regulating and maintaining process of project completion.

Kindly go through the attached Report, system workflows and demo video for more details :)
